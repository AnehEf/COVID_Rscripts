This worflow is divided in 5 steps from the transfer of the ddPCR from the GLGC to the OneDrive SARS-CoV-2 folder to the submission of the database to the CDC. 

- ddPCR raw data transfer from the GLGC's computer to the SARS-CoV-2 folder located on OneDrive
- Process ddPCR raw data to obtain the target concentration per microliter of reaction and other information
- Import the ddPCR to the "Big Spreadsheet"
- Update and curate WWTP parameters' excel spreasheets
- Generate the database to the DHS/CDC and load it to their server.

Most workflows contain mandatory **quality controls** steps, as well as a **troubleshooting** section.


Before starting, make sure OneDrive desktop (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download), RStudio and R (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/; https://cran.r-project.org/) are installed on your computer. Once it is done, make sure you created a shortcut/alias to Sandra's shared SARS-CoV-2 folder. If you don't know how to do it, just follow the tutorial here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-shortcuts-to-shared-folders-in-onedrive-for-work-or-school-d66b1347-99b7-4470-9360-ffc048d35a33#:~:text=In%20OneDrive%2C%20in%20the%20navigation,Add%20shortcut%20to%20My%20files.
