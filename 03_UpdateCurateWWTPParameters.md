# Compile the WWTP parameters

Adelaide Roguet 3-5-21

The WWTPs parameters are as important as the ddPCR data. Thus, it is important to keep that database as up-to-date as possible. To make the compilation step as smooth as possible, all WWTPs can enter their data directly on online excel spreadsheets. Some WWTPs only fill the paper sheet that is sent along with the sample.

These data will be merged to the ddPCR data using the CV number. Thus that value HAS to be accurate. All data will be reported to DHS/CDC, except the beginning and end of the sampling collection (the info is provided by the "Sample extraction" tab of the big-spreadsheet).



### Location of the excel spreadsheets

> SARS-CoV-2 > DATA > WWTPs_parameters > files.xlsx

This folder contains: 

-  1x spreadsheet per city named **CITY_parameters.xlsx**. DP & PLT are in the same spreadsheet but on different tabs. Same for JI and SS.
- 1x file named **WWTP_Parameters_Compiled.xlsx**. This file is automatically generated by R when the report to the DHS/CDC is generated. Any changes done in this file will be thus discarded.
- 1x directory named **old** it contains all the old versions of WWTP_Parameters_Compiled.xlsx. During the report generation process, R stores "WWTP_Parameters_Compiled.xlsx" in this directory before overwriting it with a new version of the file. I'm sorry if it is not clear!
- 1x directory named **MMSD_parameters** containing **CITY_parameters.xlsx** for the City of Milwaukee
- 1x file named **compile_WWTPs_parameters_v0.R**. It is this R script which combines all WWTP sheets into the file " WWTP_Parameters_Compiled.xlsx"



## Updates and manual curation



### Check everything is up-to-date and looks good: 

- The **average daily flow** is missing. SEND AN EMAIL TO THE OPERATOR RIGHT AWAY!

- Hours are correctly formated

  > Good example: 6:35am
  >
  > Bad examples: 6:35 am, 6:35:00AM, etc

- Numbers are numbers: it happens that typos in numbers occur, such as two dots in the same number, etc.

- We are collecting the conductivity and temperature at the delivery; thus if it is not up-to-date, you can only blame yourself!



### Special instructions for JI and SS

Data are not directly entered into the **MMSD_parameters.xlsx**. Instead, they are sent into the sheet called **Export_MMSDParameters.xlsx**.

- Copy and paste all the values from **Export_MMSDParameters.xlsx** to **MMSD_parameters.xlsx**. Make sure to convert the values into numbers. 

- The composite frequency for JI is not fixed; thus it has be determined for each sample. To do so, see Figure 1. Make sure when you drag the formula that the formula has not shifted from a line.
